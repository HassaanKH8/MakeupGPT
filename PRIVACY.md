## 1. Introduction

MakeupGPT ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and safeguard your information when you use the MakeupGPT mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Account Information
When you sign in with Google or Apple, we receive your full name, email address, and a unique user ID from Firebase Authentication.

#### Stored on your device:
Your display name, cached locally for instant display.

#### Stored on our servers:
Your email address and Firebase user ID, used to identify your account and link your data across sessions.

### 2.2 Photos and Images
When you use the makeup try-on feature, we collect and store:
- **Your original photo** — the photo you capture for AI processing
- **Your AI-generated result image** — the makeup look applied to your photo

Both images are stored securely in Firebase Storage and linked to your account. They are retained to power the History feature, allowing you to compare your original and AI-generated looks over time. These images are never used for advertising, shared with third parties for their own purposes, or used to train AI models.

### 2.3 Usage Data
We collect data about your use of the App, including:
- Number of makeup looks generated
- Remaining monthly quota and any purchased credits
- Subscription status and plan type

This data is linked to your account and stored on our servers.

### 2.4 Purchase Information
If you subscribe or make in-app purchases, transaction and subscription status information is processed by RevenueCat and Apple. We receive and store your subscription status and purchase history. We do not store full payment details — these are handled entirely by Apple.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your information solely to:
- Create and manage your account
- Process your photos and generate AI makeup looks
- Display your look history and enable before/after comparisons
- Enforce your monthly usage quota
- Manage subscriptions and in-app purchases
- Display non-personalized advertisements to free-tier users

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing or advertising targeting purposes.

---

## 4. Camera Access

The App requires access to your device camera to capture photos for makeup processing. Camera access is used only when you actively initiate a capture within the App. We do not access your camera in the background.

---

## 5. Data Storage and Security

- All photos and account data are stored on secure servers using Firebase (Google Cloud infrastructure).
- All data is transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections.
- Photos are stored in Firebase Storage under access rules that restrict them to your account only — other users cannot access your images.
- We implement industry-standard security practices; however, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 6. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services, each governed by their own privacy policies:

| Service | Purpose | Privacy Policy |
|---|---|---|

| Google AdMob | Non-personalized advertisements (free tier only) | [policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) |

We use Google AdMob in **non-personalized ad mode**, meaning AdMob does not use your data or device identifiers to target you with ads based on your activity in other apps or websites.

## 9. Children's Privacy

The App is rated 4+ on the App Store and is available to all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent. If you believe a child under 13 has created an account, please contact us and we will promptly delete the account and all associated data.

## 10. Your Rights

- **Deletion** — delete your account and all associated data directly within the App (Account → Delete Account), or by contacting us
